    <h1>Doctor Who</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Doctor Who is a British science fiction television series broadcast by the
      BBC since 1963. The series depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called
      the Doctor, an extraterrestrial being who appears to be human. The Doctor
      explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS.
    </p>
    <h2>Meet the Tardis</h2>

    <p>
      The TARDIS is the Doctor's ship, their home and their friend. It has been
      the one constant through all their lives; an impossible blue box, bigger
      on the inside than the outside, taking them not necessarily to where they
      wants to go, but very often where they need to be. It can reach any time
      or place, and with it the Doctor has shown the universe to a rich variety
      of companions. On occasion he's used it to save the day, from a suicidal
      game of chicken with the Master's own TARDIS, to taking on a
      space-travelling planet as it tried to absorb the Earth, and many, many
      other adventures.

    <h2>More About the Tardis!</h2>
    <p>
      The TARDIS has a chameleon circuit which should allow it to disguise
      itself, but it seems to have become stuck looking like a tall blue police
      box from 1960s Earth. Dimensionally transcendental, it appears much bigger
      on the inside than the outside. As well as a central control room from
      which it can be flown, the TARDIS has infinite other spaces â€“ a pool, a
      library, an art gallery, a junk room, a walk-in wardrobe, an aquarium, a
      zoo and a garage. Just to name a few!

    <h2>Amy and Rory Pond</h2>

    <p>
      Amy Pond and Rory Williams were the companions and in-laws of The Eleventh
      Doctor. They were fiery, flirtatious, funny, and flawed. They saw the
      universe and saved civilizations. But all who travel with The Doctor come
      to know the perils of their adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      That constant danger, sacrifice, abduction, death, and grief, are just as
      prevalent as the wonder and beauty. The Eleventh Doctor came to be reliant
      on Amy and Rory to guide him, to stabilize his whims and actions. All the
      pain they experienced, they shared.
    </p>

    <p>
      All her life, Amy had been followed by the crack in her bedroom wall. And
      it followed The Doctor, Amy, and Rory all through time and space. When
      Rory pushed The Doctor out of the way and was shot by a Silurian named
      Restac, he died. But it was when the time energy from the crack in time
      touched him that he was truly gone; erased from existence. Every memory of
      Rory vanished from Amy's mind and her own personal timeline was affected.

    <h2>Clara Oswald: The impossible girl</h2>
    <img src="./img/the_impossible_girl.jpg" alt="Clara Oswald" />
    <p>
      Clara Oswald was a companion of the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors. On
      several occasions, while the "real" Doctor was absent or incapacitated,
      she assumed the mantle, promise and name of "the Doctor", with the Twelfth
      Doctor acknowledging on one of these occasions that she "made a mighty
      fine Doctor".
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Doctor, she was "impossible" due to their meetings
      previously in his personal timeline, with two such encounters where he saw
      her die. Though assured by the empathic psychic Emma Grayling and the
      TARDIS scanner that Clara was just an "ordinary girl", the Doctor couldn't
      believe that to be true and thought her to be "the only mystery worth
      solving".
    </p>
    <p>
      While a physically ordinary human woman from the 21st century, Clara chose
      to enter the Doctor's timeline in his tomb on Trenzalore in order to try
      to reverse the damage done to his timeline by the Great Intelligence. This
      caused the time winds to shatter her into millions of what River Song
      referred to as "echoes" or "splinters" that were dispersed throughout his
      personal timeline. These echoes corrected the damage caused by the Great
      Intelligence but were not the original Clara. She was trapped in the
      Doctor's timeline but rescued shortly thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara's heroics eventually cost her greatly. While trying to prove Rigsy's
      innocence of a false murder accusation she took a Chronolock, which killed
      the one branded, from him. The Raven, who was originally set to kill
      Rigsy, killed her instead. She was later extracted from her own fixed
      point of death in her timeline by the Doctor using an extraction chamber
      on Gallifrey. In her resurrected form, Clara had none of the usual aspects
      of the living, such as breathing, having a pulse or even ageing, instead
      being stuck "between one heartbeat and the next."
